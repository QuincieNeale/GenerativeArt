# GenerativeArt
Project 1 for Creative Coding Class, generative art using inksim

This project uses InkSim and PerlinNoise to create a generative art pice that resembles a water color dot piece.

I am mainly an artist. I often like to work with water color and gauche and wanted to attempt to create a piece that resembled paint as a medium, but digitally.

I used add ons:
ofxInkSim
ofxGui
ofxMoodMachine

All you have to do is run the program. I really wanted the piece to be completely controlled by the program without human interaction. So you do not need to pres anything to make it regenerate, and the color changes on its own. I wanted it to be completely generative.
